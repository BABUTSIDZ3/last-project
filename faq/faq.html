                <p>Interviewers like to hear stories about candidates. Make sure your story has a great beginning, a
                    riveting middle, and an end that makes the interviewer root for you to win the job.</p>

                <p>Employers want to know whether you are actively seeking out their company, heard of the role from a
                    recruiter, or were recommended to the position by a current employee. In short, they want to know
                    how you got to them.</p>

                <p>Be sure to do your homework on the organization and its culture before the interview. Your research
                    will save you here. Your preferred environment should closely align to the companys workplace
                    culture (and if it doesnt, it may not be the right fit for you).</p>

                <p>The employer wants to know: Do you hold down the fort or crumble under pressure? They want to make
                    sure that you wont have a meltdown when the pressure becomes intense and deadlines are looming. </p>
